## ü§ñ Agentic AI Capabilities

At the core of Expedition AI are intelligent agents designed to automate and elevate the entire experimentation process:

-   **Autonomous Goal-Driven Experimentation**: Simply provide a high-level business objective (e.g., "Increase user engagement by 15%"), and the AI agent will autonomously design, prioritize, and propose a full sequence of experiments to achieve that goal.
-   **Hypothesis Generation**: The AI creates high-quality, testable hypotheses based on your strategic objectives and historical data, removing guesswork and manual effort.
-   **Automated Results Analysis**: The platform automatically analyzes experiment results, identifies statistically significant segments, and provides clear, actionable insights in natural language. It tells you not just *what* happened, but *why*.
-   **Strategic Learning Agendas**: The AI helps build structured learning agendas by identifying knowledge gaps and suggesting experiments to fill them, creating a strategic roadmap for continuous improvement and innovation.

## üß≠ Complete Experimentation Lifecycle Management

-   **Planning**: Kanban and timeline views for planning experiments, with AI-assisted ideation.
-   **Reviews**: A structured review workflow with feedback tracking and an approval process.
-   **Execution**: Real-time monitoring with simulation capabilities for forecasting outcomes.
-   **Knowledge Management**: A centralized, searchable repository for all experiment insights and learnings.
